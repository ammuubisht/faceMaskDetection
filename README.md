# faceMaskDetection
An Open-CV Project to detect whether a person is with or without mask. So, that we can cope better with this ongoing COVID-19 Situation. I've used a Dataset of 3725 Images of Face with Mask and 3828 Images of Face without Mask. Convolutional Neural Network comes into play in this.
